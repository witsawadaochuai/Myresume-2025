                <h3>AI & Data Engineer</h3>
                <h4>Smarterware Company Limited., Chaeng Watthana, Nontaburi, Thailand | July 2024 - February 2025</h4>
                <ul>
                    <h5><li>Legal Question Answering System using Streamlit, MongoDB, and Bedrock</li></h5>
                    <li>Developed a full-stack legal QA system that allows users to ask questions about Thai law and receive accurate answers generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). The system integrates document retrieval, question classification, embedding search, and prompt engineering to provide context-aware responses.</li>
                    <li>Key Features & Responsibilities</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>• Frontend Development: Designed and implemented an interactive Streamlit frontend, featuring user input, chat history, document upload capabilities, and administrative controls for system status management.</li>
                            <li>• Database Management (MongoDB Atlas): Established and managed MongoDB Atlas for persistent storage of legal documents (chunked with embeddings) and timestamped user conversation histories.</li>
                            <li>• AI-Powered Question Classification: Developed and integrated a custom fine-tuned PyTorch model (Model2, via Transformers) for intelligent question classification, categorizing queries into statute-related, definition-based, legal procedure/compliance, and non-legal types.</li>
                            <li>• AWS Bedrock Integration: Utilized AWS Bedrock for generating multilingual embeddings (Cohere Embed Multilingual v3) and powering legal question answering via Claude v2 (Anthropic).</li>
                            <li>• Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Implemented a robust RAG pipeline by computing cosine similarity between user queries and pre-embedded legal document chunks, filtering relevant documents based on similarity thresholds and legal type matching.</li>
                            <li>• Dynamic Prompt Engineering: Created and applied dynamic prompt templates, tailored to question type and legal context, significantly enhancing answer relevance and specificity.</li>
                            <li>• Version Control & Document Management: Integrated logic for effective version control, automatically deactivating older versions of legal sections upon the upload of newer drafts.</li>
                            <li>• Scalability & Performance: Prepared for future OCR document handling via Amazon S3 (Boto3) and optimized system performance through lru_cache for efficient embedding retrieval.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <h5><li>Computer Vision & YOLO Model Development</li></h5>
                    <li>Developed and trained custom YOLO (You Only Look Once) models for a variety of computer vision applications, demonstrating expertise in object detection, instance segmentation, and image classification.</li>
                    <li>Key Projects & Responsibilities</li>    
                        <ul>
                            <li>• Facial Feature Classification: Implemented a classification model to categorize lip features, with a dataset split of 70% for training and 30% for validation.</li>
                            <li>• Truck Object Detection: Performed detailed labeling and trained a YOLO model for precise truck detection in various images.</li>
                            <li>• Amulet Instance Segmentation: Conducted instance segmentation on amulet images, enabling fine-grained identification and analysis of individual amulets.</li>
                            <li>• Diverse Application Development: Applied custom YOLO models to unique challenges, including facial fortune-telling and amulet authentication, showcasing adaptability and problem-solving skills in computer vision.</li>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>OctaPoem-AI</h3>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This project is a Flask-based web application designed to assist with Thai poetry or lyric writing by suggesting rhyming words. It leverages the pythainlp library for Thai language processing tasks such as word tokenization, transliteration, and accessing a Thai word corpus. Additionally, it integrates a pre-trained Thai masked language model (wangchanberta) to provide AI-generated rhyming suggestions.
                    <br><br>The application allows users to input up to four lines of text. For each line, it identifies the last word and then offers a variety of rhyming suggestions for the subsequent line. These suggestions are generated from three main sources:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>• AI Model: Words suggested by the wangchanberta model based on context.</li>
                            <li>• Pronunciation-based Rhymes: Words that rhyme based on their phonetic ending.</li>
                            <li>• Vocabulary-based Rhymes: Words found in a custom vocabulary file that match the target word's sound and form.</li>
                        </ul>
                <p><strong>Technology used:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>• Python: The primary programming language for the entire application.</li>
                        <li>• Flask: A lightweight Python web framework used to build the web application, handle API requests, and serve the index.html file.</li>
                        <li>• Flask-CORS: A Flask extension to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing the frontend (presumably served from a different origin or for local development) to interact with the backend API.</li>
                        <li>PyThaiNLP: A powerful Python library for Thai Natural Language Processing. It's used for:
                            <ul>
                                <li>• Word Tokenization: Breaking down sentences into individual words (word_tokenize).</li>
